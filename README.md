# Intern-Preparations
I am going to study MIDS at Duke University and to be ready for interviews and interns.
Therefore, I decided to practice some problems and my noob solutions will be shown here. 
- In `Hackerrank_interviewprep.py` this file, it includes my solution to 3 Months HackerRank Interview Preparation Kits. Although I am pretty new to the job search in the field of Data Science/Analytics, I would assume the Python basics are necessary for the interviews :) hopefully I can get some.
- According to the requirements of MIDS program at Duke, I need to do some preparation to juan other dalaos.
