# Intern-Preparations
I am going to study MIDS(Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science) at Duke University and to be ready for interviews and interns.
This program is raltively new and I will prepare for the industy here to record my path.
Therefore, I decided to practice some problems and my noob solutions will be shown here. 
- In `Hackerrank_interviewprep.py` this file, it includes my solution to 3 Months HackerRank Interview Preparation Kits. Although I am pretty new to the job search in the field of Data Science/Analytics, I would assume the Python basics are necessary for the interviews :) hopefully I can get some.
- According to the requirements of MIDS program at Duke, I need to do some preparation to juan other dalaos.
- I heard that all you need is `https://neetcode.io/`: the blind leetcode 75 (Reference: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2PaQKcdwO_lwxz9bAnxXnIQayCouZP6d-ENrBz_NXc/edit#gid=0)
- I got accpeted in CodePath's Intro. to Software Engineering (Intro Track) Free bootcamp, and here's the syllabus: https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/intro_software_eng/overview. I think this will well prepared me for the upcoming intern applying season. I might be apply for intermediate/advanced track later. I am not sure if da/ds position require these set of skills. I really appreciate these kinds of programs existed and people might gain a lot of experiences/networking through these programs.
- I actually find a better version of the leetcode questions: the grind 75 instaed of the blind 75. Here is the link: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?difficulty=Easy. Need to be aware of `Refer` and `leetcode top 100 questions`
- Recently I found out the website for sql/ds questions only and I got the lifetime access to it: `https://www.stratascratch.com/`
#### My Progress on HackerRank Interview Problems: ![](https://us-central1-progress-markdown.cloudfunctions.net/progress/16)
#### No. of leetcode questions that I have done since 2022: 6
#### My goal here is to do 5 questions on average per week and see if I can persist on doing it. My current rank  is: 
866,984(1,060,127 3 weeks ago)

 #### Questions to consider before entering Duke
 * Fall Classes (Does everyone take the same classes? skip Intro. to NLP for Fall?)
 Answer: Yes. I have listed the first semester class above. IDS720 is optional, need to take test in bootcamp to see if required.
 * Class size for class of 2024? (male vs. female, avg. age)
 Answer: Don't know for now. Everything will be known until 4/15.
 * Electives (taking ECE/BIOSTAT/STAT)
 Answer: Will ask once arrived Duke.
 * Career Service (when to prepare and what to expect in bootcamp?)
 Answer: workshop will prepare everything.
 * Workload? 10+hrs/3units course?
 Answer: Students mentioning workload for 4 courses is pretty heavy.


## Course Experience from past students
- IDS706: Using AWS, need self-learning, complicated, easy to get A
- IDS702: linear regression，logistic regression，missing data，panel data/ hierarchical model, lots of homework and care about the grading
- IDS703: very hard for non-cs/stats students, need to calculate markov chain using best data structure, build neural network using pytorch
